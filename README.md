# WCViewPager
Android ViewPager that respects height of wrap_content.

*This is a work in progress, so there still might be bugs and edge cases not covered.*

The WrapContentViewPager is a in-place replacement for a ViewPager.
When used with wrap_content height the WrapContentViewPager will resize to the height of the selected child view and smoothly change its height when ViewPager is Scrolled.

## Including
At the moment the easiest way to include the library is to copy **[WrapConentViewPager](https://github.com/rnevet/WCViewPager/blob/master/wcviewpager/src/main/java/nevet/me/wcviewpager/WrapContentViewPager.java) Class into your project.

## Use
Just like a ViewPager, either in an XML or Code.
A simple Sample project is available for reference.
